Hi, I am Nail.
I am an undergraduate student at Middle East Technical University in Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department [.](posts/calender.md)
I am an undergraduate researcher at Research League under [Powerlab](http://power.eee.metu.edu.tr/). My research topics are;
* Thermal Analysis of Electrical Motors
* [Renewables Supply Forecasting using ANN](posts/solarforecasting.md)

We were also working on a possible TUBITAK 1512 project which is about IoT modules for Solar Energy Forecasting. Here is a post about why this is so crucial for our future grids.
Morever, we build an organization called [OpenEE](openeee.github.io) which have useful documentations and links for helping undergradute students at METU EE. To become a contributer contact [me](nailtosun@metu.edu.tr) or pull request from Github.
