Hi, I am Nail, PhD student at Newcastle University ([Sustainable Electric Propulsion CDT](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/electric-propulsion/)). 
I received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Middle East Technical University (METU), Ankara, Turkey, in 2019 and 2021 respectively. 
You can check my [calender.](posts/calender.md)

## Other Works
We were also worked on a TUBITAK 1512 project, a possible start-up which is about IoT modules for Solar Energy Forecasting. Here is a post about why this is so crucial for our future grids. Here ia a quick intro what we do (In Turkish) [link](/docs/kÄ±lavuz.pdf)
