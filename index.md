Hi, I am Nail.
 I am currently pursuing Master's degree at Middle East Technical University in Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department[.](posts/calender.md)

I am a graduate researcher at [Powerlab](http://power.eee.metu.edu.tr/).

## Research Topics
* Electromagnetic Modelling of Electromagnetic Launchers
* Control System Design, Optimization
* [Renewables Supply Forecasting using ANN](posts/solarforecasting.md)
* [Thermal Analysis of Electrical Motors](/docs/Nail_Poster.pdf)
* Electricity Load and Bid Forecasting

## Academic Papers
### Published
### Under review
* A Novel Method to Simulate Electromagnetic Launchers with Moving Armature for Calculating Rails Pressure (Submitted to Conference of Electromagnetic Field Computation, 2020)
* Electromagnetic Launcher Speed Control with a Multilevel Fast Triggering Time Algorithm (MFTTA) (Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science)
* Optimum Convex Rail Cross-Section Selection for Electromagnetic Launchers (Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science)
* Solar Power Generation Analysis and Forecasting Real-World Data Using LSTM and Autoregressive CNN (Submitted to International Conference on Smart Energy Systems and Technologies, 2020)

## Awards
* People's Choise Award: Solar Power Generation Analysis and Forecasting on Real World Data Using LSTM and Autoregressive CNN, METU EE STAR 2019

## Other Works
We were also working on a TUBITAK 1512 project, a possible start-up which is about IoT modules for Solar Energy Forecasting. Here is a post about why this is so crucial for our future grids. Here ia a quick intro what we do (In Turkish) [link](/docs/kÄ±lavuz.pdf)

## Some Posters and Presentations
* [STAR 2019: Thermal Modelling of IMMD Structure and Heat-Sink Design](/docs/Nail_Poster.pdf)
* [STAR 2019: Solar Power Generation Analysis and Forecasting on Real World Data Using LSTM and Autoregressive CNN](/docs/panel.pdf)


## Organizations
Morever, we build an organization called [OpenEE](openeee.github.io) which have useful documentations and links for helping undergradute students at METU EE. To become a contributer contact [me](nailtosun@metu.edu.tr) or pull request from Github.
