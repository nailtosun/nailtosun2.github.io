## Other Works
We were also working on a TUBITAK 1512 project, a possible start-up which is about IoT modules for Solar Energy Forecasting. Here is a post about why this is so crucial for our future grids. Here ia a quick intro what we do (In Turkish) [link](/docs/kÄ±lavuz.pdf)

## Organizations
Morever, we build an organization called [OpenEE](openeee.github.io) which have useful documentations and links for helping undergradute students at METU EE. To become a contributer contact [me](nailtosun@metu.edu.tr) or pull request from Github.
